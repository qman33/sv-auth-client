# sv-auth-client

Client for communicating with sv-auth. This npm package contains classes and helpers for communicating with the sv-auth graphQL system.

Use cases include:
* Registering permissions on the auth system for your product.
* Working with tokens from the auth system.
* Wrapping the UI of your product behind the auth system.
* Converting a token into a user and checking their permissions.

## Installation

```
npm install @simpleview/sv-auth-client
```

## Setup

For integrating your project with auth, please see the [Setup Instructions](SETUP.md).

# Package API

## AuthClient

The `AuthClient` class is for communicating with the authentication system which provides some caching and ease of use for working with `User` objects.

* args
	* graphUrl - The URL of graphQL server that you wish to communicate with. Most implementations should likely point to the live graphQL endpoint at https://graphql.simpleviewinc.com/.
	* cacheDuration - The duration of how long cache entries should remain in the AuthClient cache. Defaults to 1 hour, generally you should not pass this setting unless unit testing.

### AuthClient.getUser

This method wraps the call to `auth.users_current` in a caching layer to ensure that it's performant and is properly updating if a user's permissions have changed.

Generally you will want to make this call very early in your GraphQL stack in order to make the user available on context for all calls to access.

* args
	* token - string - The jwt token retrieved from the the auth system.
	* acct_id - string - The acct_id that you need to retrieve the user for.

Returns `auth_user`.

```js
const user = authClient.getUser({
	token,
	acct_id : "0"
});
```

### AuthClient.close

If you are finished with an AuthClient instance, call `authClient.close()` in order to shut it down. Generally this is only needed in unit tests, otherwise there is an internal `setInterval` which will keep the process open.

## getTokenFromHeaders

Extracts the token from the `authorization` header.

```js
const { getTokenFromHeaders } = require("@simpleview/sv-auth-client");
const server = new ApolloServer({
	...
	context: ({ req }) => {
		return {
			token : getTokenFromHeaders(req.headers)
		};
	}
});
```

## AdminPrefix

`AdminPrefix` can be loaded into the `sv-graphql-client` `GraphServer` to use as a client library for accessing `admin` in GraphQL.

```js
const { AdminPrefix } = require("@simpleview/sv-auth-client");
const { GraphServer } = require("@simpleview/sv-graphql-client");
const graphServer = new GraphServer({ graphUrl : GRAPH_URL, prefixes : [AdminPrefix] });
```

## AuthPrefix

`AdminPrefix` can be loaded into the `sv-graphql-client` `GraphServer` to use as a client library for accessing `auth` in GraphQL.

```js
const { AuthPrefix } = require("@simpleview/sv-auth-client");
const { GraphServer } = require("@simpleview/sv-graphql-client");
const graphServer = new GraphServer({ graphUrl : GRAPH_URL, prefixes : [AuthPrefix] });
```

## User

`User` is is returned by `AuthClient.getUser` but it can also be used without `AuthClient` when you want to convert the return from `auth.current` into a user which you wish to check permissions on.

```js
const { User } = require("@simpleview/sv-auth-client");
const result = await graphServer.auth.current({
	acct_id : "0",
	fields : `
		success
		message
		doc {
			permissionJson
		}
	`
});
const user = new User(result.doc);
user.can(["some.perm.name"]);
```

### User.can

* perms - array of strings - Returns boolean whether user has all requested permissions.

```js
const allow = user.can(["cms.something.another", "cms.another.permission"]);
```

### User.toPlain

Convert the `User` object back to a plain JS object.

# GraphQL Endpoints

This section is provided to provide additional information about the GraphQL endpoints. To see the input parameters and output of each endpoint, please view the Schema in the GraphQL Explorer at https://graphql.simpleviewinc.com/.


## auth_query

	- Bearer token must be provided in Authorization header.
	```
	query {
		auth {

				docs {
					name
					active
				}
			}
		}
	}
	```

- **account_public**
	- Returns a single account, able to be filtered by 'name' or 'acct_id'.
	- Does not require a token, publically accessible.
	```
	query {
		auth {
			account_public(filter: { name : 'test' }) {
				success
				message

- **check_token_cache**
	- Internal method used for validating caches. Should not be used in normal integrations.
	- Validates the provided token and checks the cache to verify it is stale and needs to be revalidated.
	- Success is true if the user exists and the cache entry is valid.
	- This does not refresh the token.
	- Bearer token must be provided in Authorization header.
	```
	query {
		auth {
			check_token_cache(date : "2019-03-15T23:51:17.019Z", acct_id : "0") {
